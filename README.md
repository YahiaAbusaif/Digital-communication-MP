Objective: Simulate the performance of different modulation schemes in an AWGN environment.

- BPSK
- QPSK
- FSK
- QAM 16
- QAM 64 


## **Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK)**

BPSK is a two phase modulation scheme, where the 0’s and 1’s in a binary message are represented by two different phase states in the carrier signal: θ=0∘ for binary 1 and θ=180∘ for binary 0.



## **Quadrature Phase-Shift Keying Modulation (QPSK)**

QPSK is a form of Phase Shift Keying in which two bits are modulated at once, selecting one of four possible carrier phase shifts (0, 90, 180, or 270 degrees).

## **Frequency Shift Keying (FSK)**

FSK is the digital modulation technique in which the frequency of the carrier signal varies according to the digital signal changes. FSK is a scheme of frequency modulation.



## **Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) **

QAM is a signal in which two carriers shifted in phase by 90 degrees are modulated and combined. As a result of their 90 phase difference they are in quadrature and this gives rise to the name. one signal is called the "I" signal, and the other is "Q" signal.
