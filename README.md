Objective: Simulate the performance of different modulation schemes in an AWGN environment.

- BPSK
- QPSK
- FSK
- QAM 16
- QAM 64 


## **Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK)**

BPSK is a two phase modulation scheme, where the 0’s and 1’s in a binary message are represented by two different phase states in the carrier signal: θ=0∘ for binary 1 and θ=180∘ for binary 0.
